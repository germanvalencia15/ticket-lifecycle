In this image above I changed the dept from support to System Administrators, assinged to German V and also changed SLA to SEV-A which is the highest setting since this is business critical.

This last ticket above was reassigned and as you can see by the notes was worked on and resolved.

As you can see above in the open ticket inbox all tickets have been reassigned or resolved.  No open tickets left.
